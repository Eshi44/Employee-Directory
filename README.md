# Employee Directory  ðŸ’¼ðŸ‘”

Users can filter employees within this employee directory by either first name, last name, or location. Simply search an employee using the input box and the table will begin to filter.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
